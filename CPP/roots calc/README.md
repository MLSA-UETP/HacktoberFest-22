# Quadratic Equation Roots Calculator:

This is a Root's(Quadratic Equation) Calculator programmed using C++ which works in the following way:

ðŸ“Œ Takes in the coefficient (a, b, c) of the quadratic equation.

ðŸ“Œ Then using these inputs it calculates the determinant.

ðŸ“Œ On the basis of the calculated determinant it then calculates and show the Roots of the quadratic equation.
