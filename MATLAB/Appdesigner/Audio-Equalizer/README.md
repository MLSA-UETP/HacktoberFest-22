# Grpahic Audio Equalizer

## Abstract

On a daily basis, millions of people are affected by noise pollution. Noise Induced Hearing Loss is the most common health condition it cause (NIHL). Loud noise can also lead to high blood pressure, heart disease, sleep problems, and stress. These health issues can impact people of all ages, but mainly youngsters. To tackle this problem we are proposing a solution in written in MALTAB which will either record and audio and removes noise from it along with enhancing it or load already saved audio and equalize it to have a better and melodious effect on ears and as well as health.

## Introduction

The human ear can detect a broad range of sounds. On the low end, we can hear vibrations of about 20 Hz, which is perceptible only as dull rumble. On the upper end, we can hear vibrations of approximately 20,000 Hz, which will come across as a faint whine. But in between those extremes is the sweet spot of human hearing. And we can boost or diminish specific frequencies. On the hand, noise-induced hearing loss, tinnitus, hypertension, vasoconstriction, and other cardiovascular side effects have all been linked to noise exposure. Chronic noise exposure has been linked to sleep disruptions and a higher risk of diabetes.Both analogue and digital recording equipment have characteristics that make them prone to noise. Random or white noise with no coherence, as well as coherent noise created by the device's mechanism or processing algorithms, are all examples of noise. There exists a Active noise control (ANC), also known as noise cancellation or active noise reduction (ANR), is a technique for eliminating undesired and unprocessed sound by adding a second sound that cancels out the first. Sound is a pressure wave or, to put it another way, sound is analogue signals that are processed according to their frequencyand include a compression and rarefaction phase.

#### Equalization

Equalization (EQ) is the process of weighting the frequency spectrum of an audio signal.
We can use equalization to:

- Enhance audio recordings
- Analyze spectral content
  Types of equalization include:
- Lowpass and highpass filters –– Attenuate high frequency and low frequency content,
  respectively.
- Low-shelf and high-shelf equalizers –– Boost or cut frequencies equally above or below a
  desired cutoff point.
- Parametric equalizers –– Selectively boost or cut frequency bands. Also known as
  peaking filters.

I am using MATLAB to make a GUI based tool which lets the user to either record an audio or
load an audio file for enhancing audio quality or to equalize the sound.

## Usage

1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to App Designer in MATLAB
3. Open the project GrpahicRQ.mlapp file using App Designer and run the project or directly run the GeaphicEQ.mlapp file.
